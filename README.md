My PIM - Personal Information Manager
======================================

Initially, this application is started as just a "Contacts" application.
It is built using Django.  I use the idea of a "Resource" to model
a person or organization.  The Semantic Web defines "Resources" as being
any "thing."  One of my interests is in all things related to the
"Semantic Web."  Therefore, I chose to use this concept in creating a
model to store details about a contact.  

So, a contact is a person or an organization for which I'd want to
record contact information.  In Django ( A Python Web Framework ) a model
is used to create a Database table.  I also have a model for Relationships
which is for categorizing contacts.  A contact could be for family, friends,
or it could be the contact is a professional relationship.

I don't yet have any Semantic Web features.
